Assignment 2 - The Aesthetics of Emotion
Make a first-person perspective game that is not a shooter. Create at least two levels with opposite aesthetic feel (e.g.: violent and peaceful, frantic and calm, confusing and clear, dense and sparse) Think about moods and emotions and how to reverse engineer them. This assignment will be a refresher on moving the character / camera, physical collisions, textures, and lights.


Hey Nick,
The .exe file is zipped in a folder called TaylorTest.
The first part of the game changes based on time but the second part goes on forever, so feel free to just exit the game when you have a feeling of what it is.
The game was designed to be played with a PS4/PS3 controller. (You can play with an xBox controller but the UI won't make sense)

Thanks,
-Danny
