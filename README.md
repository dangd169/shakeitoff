Assignment 2 - The Aesthetics of Emotion
Make a first-person perspective game that is not a shooter. Create at least two levels with opposite aesthetic feel (e.g.: violent and peaceful, frantic and calm, confusing and clear, dense and sparse) Think about moods and emotions and how to reverse engineer them. This assignment will be a refresher on moving the character / camera, physical collisions, textures, and lights.
